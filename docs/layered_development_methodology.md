# Layered Development Methodology

## Overview

The Layered Development Methodology is a structured approach to software development that ensures coherence, quality, and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle. By strictly adhering to sequential layers of development for each feature, this methodology promotes thorough understanding of existing code, comprehensive testing, and consistent documentation.

## Core Principles

- **Sequential Progression**: Development always proceeds through well-defined layers in sequence
- **Research First**: Always understand existing code before adding new features
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are written before implementation
- **Complete Documentation**: API is thoroughly documented after verification
- **Full Stack Implementation**: Backend and frontend are developed with clear separation of concerns

## The Seven Layers

### Layer 1: General Concept
- Define the overall idea and purpose of the feature
- Consider how it fits into the existing application
- Establish the value proposition for users
- Create high-level requirements

### Layer 2: Technical Specification
- Convert general concepts into detailed technical specifications
- Define data models, relationships, and constraints
- Outline API endpoints and behavior
- Document expected functionality in technical terms
- Update specification documents (e.g., specs.md)

### Layer 3: Server Tests
- Write comprehensive tests for the server-side functionality
- Define expected inputs and outputs through test cases
- Cover edge cases and error scenarios
- Implement test fixtures and utilities as needed
- Tests will initially fail, as implementation doesn't exist yet

### Layer 4: Server Implementation
- Implement server-side code according to specifications and tests
- Develop models, serializers, views, and other required components
- Focus on making tests pass
- Adhere to established patterns in the existing codebase
- Create database migrations as needed

### Layer 5: Test Execution and Coverage
- Run all tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- Measure code coverage to identify untested code paths
- Address any gaps in test coverage
- Refactor code and tests as necessary
- Ensure all tests pass consistently

### Layer 6: API Documentation
- Create or update comprehensive API documentation
- Document all endpoints, request formats, and response structures
- Include authentication requirements
- Provide examples of API usage
- Document error responses and status codes
- Update documentation files (e.g., api_documentation.md)

### Layer 7: Frontend Implementation
- Develop the frontend using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Organize code into multiple files for maintainability
- Implement user interface components according to specifications
- Connect frontend to backend through API calls
- Ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility
- Test frontend functionality thoroughly

## Feature Development Workflow

When developing a new feature or enhancing an existing one:

1. **Research and Analysis**:
   - Study the existing codebase thoroughly
   - Understand current architecture and patterns
   - Identify areas that will be affected by the new feature

2. **Layer-by-Layer Implementation**:
   - Progress through each layer sequentially
   - Complete each layer before moving to the next
   - Revisit previous layers if necessary based on new insights

3. **Review and Reflection**:
   - At each layer boundary, review work for quality and coherence
   - Ensure alignment with the original concept and specifications
   - Refactor as needed before proceeding

## Benefits

- **Code Coherence**: By researching existing code first and following a consistent methodology, the codebase remains coherent and follows established patterns.
- **Quality Assurance**: Test-driven development ensures functionality works as expected and regressions are caught early.
- **Maintainability**: Complete documentation and structured code organization make future maintenance easier.
- **Predictable Progress**: The sequential nature of the methodology provides clear milestones and progress indicators.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: By addressing each aspect of development in a structured way, nothing is overlooked.

## Conclusion

The Layered Development Methodology provides a disciplined approach to software development that prioritizes code quality, comprehensive testing, and thorough documentation. By following this methodology, development teams can create robust, maintainable applications while minimizing technical debt and ensuring consistent implementation patterns throughout the codebase.
