# Layered Development Methodology

## Overview

The Layered Development Methodology is a structured approach to software development that ensures coherence, quality, and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle. By strictly adhering to sequential layers of development for each feature, this methodology promotes thorough understanding of existing code, comprehensive testing, and consistent documentation.

## Core Principles

- **Sequential Progression**: Development always proceeds through well-defined layers in sequence
- **Research First**: Always understand existing code before adding new features
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are written before implementation
- **Complete Documentation**: API is thoroughly documented after verification
- **Full Stack Implementation**: Backend and frontend are developed with clear separation of concerns

## The Seven Layers

### Layer 1: General Concept
- Define the overall idea and purpose of the feature
- Consider how it fits into the existing application
- Establish the value proposition for users
- Create high-level requirements

### Layer 2: Technical Specification
- Convert general concepts into detailed technical specifications
- Define data models, relationships, and constraints
- Outline API endpoints and behavior
- Document expected functionality in technical terms
- Update specification documents (e.g., specs.md)

### Layer 3: Server Tests
- Write comprehensive tests for the server-side functionality
- Define expected inputs and outputs through test cases
- Cover edge cases and error scenarios
- Implement test fixtures and utilities as needed
- Tests will initially fail, as implementation doesn't exist yet

### Layer 4: Server Implementation
- Implement server-side code according to specifications and tests
- Develop models, serializers, views, and other required components
- Focus on making tests pass
- Adhere to established patterns in the existing codebase
- Create database migrations as needed

### Layer 5: Test Execution and Coverage
- Run all tests to ensure functionality works as expected
- Measure code coverage to identify untested code paths
- Address any gaps in test coverage
- Refactor code and tests as necessary
- Ensure all tests pass consistently

### Layer 6: API Documentation
- Create or update comprehensive API documentation
- Document all endpoints, request formats, and response structures
- Include authentication requirements
- Provide examples of API usage
- Document error responses and status codes
- Update documentation files (e.g., api_documentation.md)

### Layer 7: Frontend Implementation
- Develop the frontend using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Organize code into multiple files for maintainability
- Implement user interface components according to specifications
- Connect frontend to backend through API calls
- Ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility
- Test frontend functionality thoroughly

## Application in Different Scenarios

### New Project Development

When developing a new project from scratch, the Layered Development Methodology provides a structured path from concept to completion:

1. **Project Setup Phase**:
   - Begin with an architectural planning layer before Layer 1
   - Establish technology stack, design patterns, and coding standards
   - Create project documentation templates
   - Set up development, staging, and production environments
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines

2. **Methodology Application**:
   - Apply all seven layers to each major feature
   - Start with core features that establish the foundation
   - Develop in vertical slices (complete features) rather than horizontal layers (all models, then all controllers, etc.)
   - Conduct regular review sessions at layer boundaries

3. **Project Management Integration**:
   - Map layers to sprint planning
   - Track progress through layer completion
   - Use layer completion as milestone markers
   - Develop estimation guidelines based on historical layer completion times

4. **Quality Gates**:
   - Define "Definition of Done" for each layer
   - Implement formal review and approval processes between layers
   - Establish minimum quality metrics for progression

### Maintaining and Enhancing Existing Projects

For existing projects, the methodology must be adapted to work with established codebases:

1. **Initial Assessment Phase**:
   - Begin with a comprehensive codebase review
   - Document existing architecture and patterns
   - Identify technical debt and pain points
   - Create a baseline of test coverage and documentation

2. **Retrofitting Process**:
   - If documentation is lacking, start by creating it for existing features
   - Add tests for existing functionality before making changes
   - Gradually improve test coverage during enhancement work

3. **Enhancement Flow**:
   - Follow all seven layers for new features
   - For bug fixes, focus on Layers 3-5 (test, fix, verify)
   - For refactoring, emphasize Layers 2-5 (specification, test, implementation, verification)

4. **Technical Debt Reduction**:
   - Allocate specific time for addressing technical debt
   - Prioritize areas with highest impact on development velocity
   - Use the methodology to guide debt reduction in manageable chunks

### Small Team Adaptations

For smaller teams with resource constraints:

1. **Layer Consolidation**:
   - Combine related layers for efficiency (e.g., Layers 3 and 4)
   - Use lightweight documentation formats
   - Implement "just enough" testing to ensure quality

2. **Role Definition**:
   - Clarify who is responsible for each layer
   - Establish clear handoff processes between team members

3. **Tool Automation**:
   - Automate as much of the process as possible
   - Use templates for documentation and test creation
   - Implement CI/CD to automate test execution and deployment

### Large Team Adaptations

For larger organizations with multiple teams:

1. **Parallelization Strategy**:
   - Establish clear dependencies between layers and teams
   - Define synchronization points
   - Implement feature flags to manage partial deployments

2. **Specialized Teams**:
   - Consider specialized teams for certain layers (e.g., dedicated test engineers)
   - Establish center of excellence for architectural guidance
   - Implement cross-team code reviews

3. **Governance Process**:
   - Create governance framework for layer progression
   - Establish escalation paths for blocking issues
   - Implement metrics to track methodology effectiveness

## Integration with Agile Practices

The Layered Development Methodology can be integrated with Agile practices:

1. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Plan sprints around specific layers for features
   - Estimate complexity at the layer level
   - Consider layer dependencies in sprint planning

2. **Daily Stand-ups**:
   - Track progress through layers
   - Identify blockers at specific layers
   - Coordinate handoffs between layers

3. **Sprint Reviews**:
   - Demo completed layers
   - Gather feedback relevant to subsequent layers
   - Adjust plans based on stakeholder input

4. **Retrospectives**:
   - Evaluate effectiveness of each layer
   - Identify improvements to layer processes
   - Adjust layer definitions and deliverables as needed
